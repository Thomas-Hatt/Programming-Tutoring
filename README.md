# Thomas Hatt's Intro to Programming Tutoring
Welcome to the official repository for my Intro to Programming tutoring website! This site is dedicated to documenting Programs that I've developed for my local college's introductory programming course.

This resource is designed to help you succeed by breaking down complex programming tasks into manageable steps, focusing on core concepts, function design, and achieving the required output.

## 🎯 About the Course & Content
This tutoring resource follows the curriculum structure for the college's Introduction to Programming course, which primarily uses Python.

Each module in this repository corresponds to a specific programming assignment (e.g., Program 1, Program 2, etc.) and contains detailed analysis, conceptual approaches, and often pseudocode to guide you toward a successful solution.

I have a dedicated page for every single program in the class.

## 📖 How Content Pages Are Structured
Each individual program page (like the one you mentioned for Program 5) is structured to mirror the assignment's requirements, ensuring you address every component of the task:

### Task
A brief, real-world scenario and the primary objective of the program.

### Input
Details on what the user must enter, including specific prompts, data types, and required letter-based function selections (e.g., 'C' for Calculate, 'D' for Display, 'X' for Exit).

Process & Functions
This section is critical and outlines the exact structure required for the Python program, including required function names, their arguments, and their return values.

### Example Function Requirements:

DisplayMenu(): Accepts zero arguments, returns nothing. (e.g., displays current prices).

CalcTotal(): Accepts zero arguments, returns a single value (e.g., the cost of the selected item).

CalcTax(subtotal): Accepts one argument, returns a single value (e.g., calculated sales tax).

Output Scenarios
Clear examples showing exactly what the program should display for different user actions (e.g., selecting 'C' to calculate, 'D' to display the menu, or 'X' to exit).

## 🤝 Need More Help?
While this repository provides the structure and guidance, the best way to learn is through one-on-one help! Feel free to reach out if you need clarification on a specific topic, debugging help, or a deeper dive into concepts like loops, conditionals, or data structures.

Good luck with your programming journey!
